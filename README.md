# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

A Smart Solution for Early Disease Detection

## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System is an advanced AI-driven healthcare assistant designed for early disease detection and prediction. By leveraging machine learning and medical image analysis, this system evaluates patient data to identify potential health conditions. The project lays the foundation for a scalable AI-based diagnostic tool, with future plans for feature integration and accuracy enhancement.

## Key Features

* Automated Disease Prediction – Uses AI models to analyze medical data and predict potential health risks.
* Supports Multiple Data Inputs – Works with medical images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) and structured health records.
* Real-Time Analysis – Provides quick and accurate diagnostic results based on patient data.
* Visual Interpretation – Highlights affected areas in medical scans for better understanding.
* User-Friendly Web Interface – Easy-to-use interface for uploading medical reports and viewing analysis results.
* Powered by Deep Learning Models – Ensures high accuracy and reliability in medical diagnostics.
